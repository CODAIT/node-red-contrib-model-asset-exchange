Use the Node-RED flows in this directory to experiment with the Model Asset Exchange nodes included in the [node-red-contrib-model-asset-exchange](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-model-asset-exchange) module. If you are not familiar with this module [take a look at this tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/learn-how-to-leverage-deep-learning-in-your-node-red-flows/).

Getting started flows:
 - [Localize and identify multiple objects in a single image](https://flows.nodered.org/flow/33d3214c1f5774009ffbc983c96f1594)
 - [Generate captions that describe the content of an image](https://flows.nodered.org/flow/ab4de9fdc1e2f63e472ada8976b422b7)
 - [Identify sounds in short audio clips](https://flows.nodered.org/flow/eaef0871ea62242d32f370d9352ee4ca)
 - [Recognize faces in an image and extract embedding vectors for each face](https://flows.nodered.org/flow/b2c1dcb5a211cf95215a3592484a31c2)
 - [Classify an image](https://flows.nodered.org/flow/8e6fbc1ad88a156c040aa0f96031f04a)
 - [Detect humans in an image and estimate the pose for each person](https://flows.nodered.org/flow/1ef026c41e36a6f2fcca1ec2de342678)
 - [Recognize faces in an image and estimate the age of each face](https://flows.nodered.org/flow/88ef2571da15e7e127afab685d131ca3)
 - [Identify objects in an image, additionally assigning each pixel of the image to a particular object](https://flows.nodered.org/flow/d905e599add7f49cb71890df78b458d7)
 - [Classify images according to the place/location labels in the Places365 data set](https://flows.nodered.org/flow/196917d2af313396a0bf3c737c9d2d5b)
 - [Detect faces in an image and predict the emotional state of each person](https://flows.nodered.org/flow/1927b6bd87cb18f17a52e9e23dcf451e)

Raspberry Pi flows:
 - [Capture an image with the raspi-camera and display it with a generated caption on the Node-RED Dashboard](https://flows.nodered.org/flow/abe41021d95ebabd28b4aaa8e68f4185)
 - [Detect faces in an image captured with the raspi-camera and display it with a facial bounding box on the Node-RED Dashboard](https://flows.nodered.org/flow/d6e8d65122875fd46aece59fb84ac351)
